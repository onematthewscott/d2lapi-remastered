# Welcome to the MSU D2L Instructor API

This program has been updated and optimized as a part of a project for the Enhanced Digital Learning Initiative. The system serves as a D2L Parsing Script and an API for the Brightspace D2L LMS. This provides more intuitive, insightful, and accessibly student performance data to researchers and instructors. Primarily this involves converting D2L's default format for survey data into a more useful, condensed form. 

## NEW AUTHORS
- Matthew Scott Hernandez <herna757@msu.edu>
