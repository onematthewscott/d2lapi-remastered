# Anaconda instructions and installation



**Windows** 

1. Download the Anaconda installer. 

2. Go to your Downloads folder and double-click the installer to launch. To prevent permission errors, do not launch the installer from the Favorites folder. 

3. Click Next. 

4. Read the licensing terms and click I Agree. 

5. Select a destination folder to install Anaconda and click Next. Install Anaconda to a directory path that does not contain spaces or unicode characters. For more information on destination folders, see the FAQ. 

6. Register Anaconda as your default Python 

7. Click Install. If you want to watch the packages Anaconda is installing, click Show Details. 

8. Click Next. 

9. After a successful installation you will see the “Thanks for installing Anaconda” dialog box 

10. Verify your installation. 

 



**MacOS** 

1. Download the graphical macOS installer for your version of Python. 

2. Double-click the downloaded file and click Continue to start the installation. 

3. Answer the prompts on the Introduction, Read Me, and License screens. 

4. Click Change Install Location to install Anaconda Distribution for all users or on a specific disk. This is not recommended. Install for me only is the default (and recommended) selection. Click Continue to return to Installation Type. 

5. Click Install to install Anaconda in the opt folder in your user directory (recommended). 

6. Once the install is complete, click Continue. 

7. Verify your installation. 

 



**Linux** 

1. In your browser, download the Anaconda installer for Linux. 

2. Search for “terminal” in your applications and click to open. 

3. Enter bash ~/Downloads/Anaconda3-2020.05-Linux-x86_64.sh in the terminal 

4. Press Enter to review the license agreement. Then press and hold Enter to scroll. 

5. Enter “yes” to agree to the license agreement. 

6. Use Enter to accept the default install location, use CTRL+C to cancel the installation, or enter another file path to specify an alternate installation directory. If you accept the default install location, the installer displays PREFIX=/home/<USER>/anaconda<2/3> and continues the installation. It may take a few minutes to complete. 

7. The installer prompts you to choose whether to initialize Anaconda Distribution by running conda init. Anaconda recommends entering “yes”. If you enter “no”, then conda will not modify your shell scripts at all. In order to initialize after the installation process is done, first run source [PATH TO CONDA]/bin/activate and then run conda init. See FAQ. 

8. Close and re-open your terminal window for the installation to take effect, or enter the command source ~/.bashrc to refresh the terminal. 

9. Verify your installation.
