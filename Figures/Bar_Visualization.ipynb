    "Our core project does not have a clear need for visualization, however, we know that visualization is a key part of any data scientist's work, and wanted to use this milestone as an opportunity to provide extra functionality to our sponsors. This being said, to decide what kind of visualization to make we asked our sponsors if there are any visualizations or graphs that aren't already available in the D2L interface (or are availiable but not optimized) that may be helpful to instructors and researchers using our project! They said that they thought a graph showing the frequency of students' overall quiz scores would likely be the most valuable. We took this insight and decided to run with it, creating an interactive visualization that shows the frequency of scores for the full quiz, and each question, based on the value selected in an interactive dropdown. This will likely be incoporated as extra functionality in our D2L library. \n",

Please ensure that these are downloaded to your local machine in the same directory as this notebook. \n",

It is assumed that you already have python and Jupyter Notebooks set up for this notebook, but our \"INSTALL.md\" can help with that process if they are not already installed."
